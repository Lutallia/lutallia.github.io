                    <p class="main-text"><b>Geometry Dash</b> (abbr. <b>GD</b> or <b>GmD</b>) is a 2D runner-style game developped by <b>RobTop Games</b>, whose founder is a Swedish game developer named <b>Robert Topala</b>. Until now it has a history for about 8 years. Many People consider GmD as a relaxing mini game, which was indeed the case at the beginning, but after a couple of years of rapid development, especially thank to the contribution from the players, it has grown into a marvelous, amazing subculture in the domain of gaming.</p>
                    <br />    
                    <p class="main-text">This fact, however, is not realized by a lot of beginners of this game. That's the purpose of this small web-based brochure - I hope it can guide those who just started playing GmD but know little about it into the big, real world we created based on this game.</p>

                    <p class="main-text">Geometry Dash was first released on August 13, 2013 for iOS and Android, and later on December 22, 2014 for Steam. There its version was marked with 1.0. Each version by every update after that was increased by 0.1 (sometimes +0.01 for small updates), so like 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, ... Nowadays people like to talk about, in general, four epochs of Geometry Dash, which are 1.9, 2.0, 2.1 and before 1.9. Some people call the update 1.9 a revolution; 2.0 as well, but the update 2.1 and the coming 2.2 are considered by some people "over-updated".</p>
