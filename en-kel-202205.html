            <p class="main-text"><b>Geometry Dash</b> (abbr. <b>GD</b> or <b>GmD</b>) is a 2D runner-style game developped by <b>RobTop Games</b>, whose founder is a Swedish game developer named <b>Robert Topala</b>. Until now it has a history for about 8 years. Many People consider GmD as a relaxing mini game, which was indeed the case at the beginning, but after a couple of years of rapid development, especially thank to the contribution from the players, it has grown into a marvelous, amazing subculture in the domain of gaming.</p>
            <br />    
            <p class="main-text">This fact, however, is not realized by a lot of beginners of this game. That's the purpose of this small web-based brochure - I hope it can guide those who just started playing GmD but know little about it into the big, real world we created based on this game.</p>
